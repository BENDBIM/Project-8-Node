# Node

- is NOT language or library or framework
- is a JS runtime environment

- Created By: Ryan Dhal
- Contains JS Engine -> V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Chakra (Edge)
- JS engine executes JS

Browser -> document, window
Node -> 'global' object
provides modules: process, console, fs, event

V8 -> JS engine -> JIT (Compilation)

# Modules
